As the original developers have suspended work on this "elegant music client for MPD"
(the latest commit in the official repository is dated 29 Oct 2009), I decided to make some
improvements and bugfixes on my own. And here they are...

**IMPLEMENTED FEATURES**:
* panel icons for Ubuntu Mono Dark icon theme (see umd-icons branch)
* saving fetched lyrics into mp3's id3tags (**requires** python eyeD3 module)
* temporary disabling gnome-screensaver in fullscreen mode
* some improvements for multi-CD albums
* support for MPD "single" and "consume" modes (**requires** latest development version
of python-mpd, because current stable v0.2.1 doesn't support these MPD modes; you
can get latest version from "jatreuman.indefero.net":http://jatreuman.indefero.net/p/python-mpd/ or "thejat.be":http://git.thejat.be/python-mpd.git/)

**TODO**:
* 'Love' button for last.fm
* 'alway start in tray' option into preferences
* open playlists like directories in playlist tab
* 'add all from this artist/album/genre' menu item
* do not show notification if sonata is active/visible
* ability to hide "XX songs, XX minutes" line in artists library view
* automatic feeding playlist with similar tracks from mpd library
* support for composer, conductor and may be some other tags
* playlist of local tracks that are loved/toprated on last.fm (may be as a separate plugin)
* reading artworks from id3tags
