As the original developers have suspended work on this "elegant music client for MPD"
(the latest commit in the official repository is dated 29 Oct 2009), I decided to make some
improvements and bugfixes on my own. And here they are...

**IMPLEMENTED FEATURES**:
* saving fetched lyrics into mp3's id3tags
* temporary disabling gnome-screensaver in fullscreen mode
* some improvements for multi-CD albums

**TODO**:
* add 'Love' button for last.fm
* playlist of local tracks that are loved/toprated on last.fm (may be as separate plugin)
* automatic feeding playlist with similar tracks from mpd library

__For more information see official README file.__
